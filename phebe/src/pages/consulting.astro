        Having previously worked as a Principal Software Engineer in two
        startups, and having made several major technical contributions before
        that, I am now an independent software engineer and
        <a href="/blog/2024/06/post-architecture">post-architect</a>. I have a
        gettings-things-done mentality and don't shy away from tackling some of
        the tougher challenges in software engineering. I'm also active as a
        core contributor to <a href="https://biomejs.dev" target="_blank"
            >Biome</a
        >.
    </p>
    <p>I specialize in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plugin architectures</li>
        <li>Hybrid (cross-language) development</li>
        <li>Development tooling</li>
        <li>Real-time collaboration</li>
        <li>Complex code migrations</li>
        <li>Rust & TypeScript</li>
        <li>Generally things involving complex algorithms :)</li>
