Linus Torvals: 
(*) I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer 
and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures 
more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers 
worry about data structures and their relationships.

John Carmack:
A large fraction of the flaws in software development are due to programmers not fully understanding all the possible states their code may execute in. … No matter what language you work in, programming in a functional style provides benefits.  You should do it whenever it is convenient, and you should think hard about the decision when it isn’t convenient.
