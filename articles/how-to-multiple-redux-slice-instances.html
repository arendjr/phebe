    This post describes a technique for creating multiple instances of a Redux
    state slice within the same store. I believe this technique can be useful
    if your application deals with multiple tabs or documents.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Heads-up:</b> This post assumes prior experience with Redux and is aimed
    at medium to expert-level engineers.
</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    When you use Redux, you should be familiar with the concept of a state
    slice, sometimes referred to as a subtree. They are a part of your state
    tree that is managed by its own reducer. Commonly, people use
    <code>combineReducers()</code> to create their root reducer from smaller
    ones; one per slice.
</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>In this example we only have a single slice, <code>todos</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const reducer = combineReducers({ todos: todosReducer });</code></pre>
<p>
    But what if we want to have multiple tabs in our application, where every
    tab has its own TODO list?
</p>
<p>
    A naive approach would be to make <code>todosReducer</code> aware of the
    fact we support multiple tabs and let its state slice reflect this.
    Unfortunately, this becomes unwieldy fast as every TODO action needs to
    have an identifier for the right tab in its payload and the reducer needs to
    account for this in how it handles each and every action. The problem
    becomes even bigger when besides <code>todos</code>, other slices need to
    account for the tabs as well.
</p>
<p>
    So ideally, we would be able to compose our reducers in such a way that we
    can use our <code>todosReducer</code>, and possibly any other reducers,
    unaltered.
</p>
<p>
    Fortunately, we can! It takes a little bit more effort than simply calling
    a helper like <code>combineReducers()</code>, so I'll show you how to do
    this step-by-step.
</p>
<h2>1. Define the state slice for the tabs</h2>
<p>
    Using TypeScript, we define the types for the state slice. There will be
    two types: one to keep the state per-tab and one to keep the state of which
    tabs are open.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type Tab = {
  readonly id: string;
  readonly todos: TodosState;
};

type TabsState = {
  readonly activeTabId: string | null;
  readonly tabs: { [id: string]: Tab };
};</code></pre>
<p>
    As you can see, the state per-tab simply contains the <code>todos</code>
    slice, plus the ID of the tab.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>TabsState</code> type then simply tracks the tabs by ID. And it
    decides which of them is active.
</p>
<p>
    Now that we know what the tabs slice looks like, we can define its
    <code>initialState</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const initialState: TabsState = {
  activeTabId: null,
  tabs: {},
};
</code></pre>
<h2>2. Create action wrapper</h2>
<p>
    Before we move on to the reducer, we will first create an action wrapper.
    What is an action wrapper, you ask? It's an action creator that wraps
    another action. Like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const WITH_TAB = "WITH_TAB";

type WrappedTabAction = {
  type: typeof WITH_TAB;
  payload: { action: TodoAction; tabId: string };
};

function withTab(
  tabId: string,
  action: TodoAction
): WrappedTabAction {
  return { type: WITH_TAB, payload: { action, tabId } };
}</code></pre>
<p>
    So now if we have an <code>addTodo(task)</code> action creator,
    we could use it like this to add the TODO to the correct tab:
    <code>dispatch(withTab(tabId, addTodo("Hello")))</code>
</p>
<p>
    Does it look like a hassle to wrap all your action creators like that?
    Don't worry, we'll get back to this and have a look on how to make this
    more ergonomic later.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, did you notice we wrapped <code>TodoAction</code> in the code
    above? If there were multiple slices inside a tab, that would be replaced
    with a <code>TabAction</code> type that would be a union over all the
    action types that can be wrapped.
</p>
<h2>3. Create the reducer</h2>
<p>
    With all that in place, we can now create our reducer. It will be split
    into two functions, which correspond to the two types we created earlier:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">function tabReducer(state: Tab, action: TabAction): Tab {
  const todos = todosReducer(state.todos, action);
  if (todos === state.todos) {
    return state;
  } else {
    return { ...state, todos };
  }
}

function tabsReducer(
  state = initialState,
  action: AppAction
): TabsState {
  switch (action.type) {
    case WITH_TAB: {
      const {
        action: unwrappedAction,
        tabId
      } = action.payload;

      let changed = false;
      const tabs: { [id: string]: Tab } = {};
      for (const [id, tab] of Object.entries(state.tabs)) {
        if (id === tabId) {
          const newTab = tabReducer(tab, unwrappedAction);
          if (newTab !== tab) {
            changed = true;
          }

          tabs[id] = newTab;
        } else {
          tabs[id] = tab;
        }
      }

      if (changed) {
        return { ...state, tabs };
      } else {
        return state;
      }
    }
  default:
    return state;
  }
}</code></pre>
<p>
    The first function simply delegates to the <code>todoReducer</code>. Note
    how it returns the original state object if there were no changes. This is
    important to maintain identity, so that selectors don't need to be
    re-evaluated.
</p>
<p>
    The second function is the heart of this entire technique, you might say.
    Whenever a wrapped action comes along, it unwraps it and goes through the
    tabs to apply it to the correct one. Once again, it checks to see if there
    are changes, so that it can maintain identity if there aren't.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, note the reference to an <code>AppAction</code> in the signature
    of <code>tabsReducer</code>. This is expected to be a union over all the
    action types that may be dispatched in your app. If you don't have a
    defined type for that, you could replace it with <code>AnyAction</code>,
    but you may need to explicitly cast <code>action</code> inside the
    <code>case</code> branch then. In any case, I do advise you to have such a
    type for reasons I'll discuss below.
</p>
<h2>4. Update your selectors</h2>
<p>
    Now there is only one piece of the puzzle left: your selectors. It's likely
    you already had a selector for your TODO state:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const selectTodos = (state: RootState) => state.todos;</code></pre>
<p>
    This selector wouldn't work anymore, because <code>todos</code> is no
    longer part of your root state. Instead, it is found under your tabs now.
    So how to update the selector?
</p>
<p>
    First, we'll create a selector for retrieving the active tab using
    <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect">Reselect</a>'s
    <code>createSelector()</code>:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const selectTabs = (state: RootState) => state.tabs;

const selectActiveTab = createSelector(
  [selectTabs],
  (state) => {
    const { activeTabId } = state;
    const activeTab =
      activeTabId && state.tabs[activeTabId];
    if (!activeTab) {
      throw new Error("No active tab");
    }
    return activeTab;
  }
);</code></pre>
<p>
    As you can see, this selector throws whenever there is no active tab. As a
    result, you should only use it inside components that live inside a tab,
    because that will guarantee there is an active tab. If that is an
    acceptable trade-off for you, you're probably happy to leave this exception
    in. The alternative is to allow the selector to return
    <code>undefined</code>, which means you will need to handle that case
    everywhere you use the selector.
</p>
<p>
    And now your TODO selector can simply be rewritten to become:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">const selectTodos = createSelector(
  [selectActiveTab],
  (tab) => tab.todos
);</code></pre>
<h2>Bonus: Dispatch hooks</h2>
<p>
    The foundation is there now, but we are still lacking in the ergonomics
    department. Remember how every time we want to dispatch a tab action, we
    need to wrap it like this,
    <code>dispatch(withTab(tabId, addTodo("Hello")))</code>?
</p>
<p>
    There are two problems with this. First of which, it requires us to know the
    <code>tabId</code>, which means we often need to use a selector just for
    that purpose. That's going to get inconvenient fast, so what we may want to
    do is the following: we can create a new action wrapper called
    <code>withActiveTab()</code>, which works the same as <code>withTab()</code>
    except it doesn't require a <code>tabId</code> in the payload, because the
    reducer already knows which tab that is anyway. If you think this is
    something you want, I trust you can make the necessary adjustments to the
    reducer on your own.
</p>
<p>
    The other problem is that it is easy to make mistakes. After all, which
    actions should be wrapped, and which ones shouldn't? Now, remember we
    briefly touched upon those <code>AppAction</code> and <code>TabAction</code>
    types? This is where those types become valuable. Because if we have a
    closed <code>TabAction</code> type that is a union over all the action types
    for slices that are under your <code>tabs</code> slice, your
    <code>withTab()</code> wrapper will reject any action that is not explicitly
    a part of that union. Similarly, if we have a closed <code>AppAction</code>
    type, which should explicitly <i>not</i> contain the tab actions, and we use
    that type in the signature of our <code>dispatch()</code> function, then we
    cannot accidentally dispatch tab actions without wrapping them first.
</p>
<p>
    So knowing all this, we can define two React hooks for giving us two
    separate dispatch functions, one for regular "app" dispatching, and one for
    "tab" dispatching. This way, we get both convenience and type safety:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-ts">type AppDispatch = (action: AppAction) => void;

type TabDispatch = (action: TabAction) => void;

const dispatch = store.dispatch as AppDispatch;
    
const useAppDispatch = () => dispatch;
const useActiveTabDispatch = () => (action: TabAction) =>
  dispatch(withActiveTab(action));</code></pre>
<h2>Wrapping up</h2>
<p>
    At this point you should have an understanding of all the pieces necessary to
    create multiple instances of state slices in your own store: the types you
    need, how to wrap actions, the reducer implementation and the changes to your
    selectors. And with the custom hooks, its usage is even reasonably ergonomic.
</p>
<p>
    Now, there are a few things missing still, which I will leave as an exercise
    to the reader:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>How to display the tabs is entirely up to your own application. When you
        do try to build this, you might find that you want to be explicit about
        the ordering of the tabs as well, something we didn't consider so far.
    </li>
    <li>Actions for manipulating the tabs, such as opening, closing and selecting
        tabs have not yet been implemented.
    </li>
    <li>You may want to extend our custom dispatchers so that they can dispatch
        thunks as well.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Shameless plug</h3>

    tooling using React, Rust and WebAssembly. Does this like something you'd be
