<h1>Selectivity v3 adds React support</h1>
<p>
    From the start, Selectivity has been developed as a jQuery plugin. It used
    jQuery internally as well as exposed a typical jQuery plugin API. But given
    that my own use cases involve more and more React, I wanted to bring
    Selectivity along into a world where using jQuery is no longer a given. The
    past few months I've gradually rewritten the Selectivity internals so they
    became independent of jQuery. It was quite a bit of work, with nothing
    really to show for it...
</p>
<p>
    But today I released
    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/selectivity/releases/tag/3.0.0-beta1">
        Selectivity v3.0.0-beta1</a
    >
    with the official React API! When you download this latest release, you can
    simply choose to use the jQuery bundle or the React bundle and each comes
    with its appropriate API and plugins. If you're adventurous, you can even
    use the VanillaJS bundle that depends on neither library. I have updated the
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/">Selectivity homepage</a> to
    (hopefully) make it clear how to use each API.
</p>
<p>
    Also new (or at least: finally usable) is the NPM release. I have added
    extensive instructions on
    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/selectivity#using-npm"
        >how to use the NPM release</a
    >
    on the GitHub project page. I have to admit having a triple-API model
    certainly makes things more complicated in that area. But then again, the
    alternative would be to create separate projects for each API and each
    plugin, and I would be stuck with 13 projects to maintain. I guess it would
    certainly be more in the spirit of NPM, but I hope I struck a good balance
    here :)
</p>
<p>
    I'd be happy to receive bug reports and suggestions for improvements (not in
    the least when it comes to the documentation!). Cheers!
