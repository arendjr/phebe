    <b>Update:</b> This post mentioned the release of Select3 v1.0. The project
    has since been renamed to Selectivity.js and all references in this post
    have been updated.
</p>
<p>
    <b>tl;dr:</b> Selectivity.js now supports
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/#select-a-city-by-timezone"
        >submenus</a
    >.

    Do you know the feeling when you've built some awesome code that's
    super-flexible and extensible and everything, opening endless possibilities
    and unimaginable scenarios, only to realize in hindsight that all this
    over-engineering was wasted effort and all this true potential of the code
    never materialized because it simply wasn't what you actually <i>needed</i>?
    It's a very common trap that I think pretty much every software engineer has
    fallen into at least once in his career... Which is why it's fun to write
    about when the opposite happens.
</p>
<p>
    Recently I took it upon myself to create a new library called
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/">Selectivity</a>. It was
    originally called Select3 because it's actually a reimplementation of the
    popular <a href="https://select2.github.io/">Select2</a> library. The main
    reason I decided to go my own way and make a from-scratch reimplementation
    was because I needed more flexibility and had to facilitate some use cases
    involving highly customized dropdowns that Select2 just wouldn't cooperate
    on. So I made it flexible and modular and everything. Then I integrated it
    into <a href="https://www.speakap.com/">our product</a> and implemented our
    use cases and all seemed said and done.
</p>
<p>
    Until last week some requirements fell upon my plate and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/tomkleijn">my colleague</a> jokingly said,
    "that's a nice job for your Selectivity". I scratched my beard a bit, gave
    it a thought, then gave it a shot. As obvious as it is now, this was
    actually a use-case I hadn't anticipated in advance. All that was needed was
    the ability to open submenus from the main dropdown and the submenus should
    contain a search input to be able to search among the results as shown in
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/select3/#select-a-city-by-timezone"
        >this example</a
    >. And all that was needed to implement it was another Selectivity module
    and some minor tweaks.
</p>
<p>
    Now, for those using Selectivity.js, let me explain how you can create your
    own select input with submenus. All the results from which the user can
    select an item are specified as objects with id and text properties. These
    are either set on the Selectivity instance using the items option (to set a
    static array of result items) or through the query function (to fetch a
    dynamic set of result items based on search terms). Now, if you want to
    attach a submenu to a result item, all you need to do is set a submenu
    property on the item. This submenu property should be another object and in
    it you can again specifiy an items array or a query function like you did
    for the main Selectivity instance. Optionally, you can also specify the
    showSearchInput option (whether or not the submenu should contain its own
    search input) and/or the positionDropdown function (to customize the
    positioning of the submenu's dropdown; this method has the same signature as
    the positionDropdown function you can specify for the Selectivity instance).
</p>
<p>Example code from the example linked above:</p>
<pre>
$('#example-4').selectivity({
    allowClear: true,
    items: [{
        id: '+00:00',
        text: 'Western European Time Zone',
        submenu: {
            items: [
                { id: 4, text: 'Barcelona' }
                /*, ...*/
            ],
            showSearchInput: true
        }
    } /*, ...*/],
    placeholder: 'No city selected'
});</pre
>
<p>That's all!</p>
