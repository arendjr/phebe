<h2>fp-bindgen&nbsp;— a bindings generator for full-stack WASM plugins
</h2>
<p>Today, we’re announcing the release of a library for generating
    bindings for full-stack WASM plugins:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/fiberplane/fp-bindgen" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">fp-bindgen</a>. Full-stack WASM
    plugins are plugins that can run both on the client and the server.&nbsp;fp-bindgen&nbsp;makes it easy to author
    these plugins, and provides the tooling for hosting them. We’ve been using&nbsp;fp-bindgen&nbsp;internally for the
    past several months and feel it has matured to a point where others may benefit from it as well.</p>
<h2>What&nbsp;fp-bindgen&nbsp;offers us</h2>
<p>At Fiberplane, we are avid users of WebAssembly. We use it for
    our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.fiberplane.com/fiberplane-providers/" rel="noopener">Fiberplane Providers</a>, as
    well as for
    most of the core logic that powers our Fiberplane Studio product. As such, we needed a first-class tool for
    authoring and hosting WebAssembly plugins that ticked all of our boxes:</p>
<ul
    style="--framer-font-size: 18px; --framer-text-alignment: left; --framer-text-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); --framer-text-decoration: none; --framer-text-transform: none;">
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Can be used both inside browsers as well as from Rust-based
            host environments</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Works well with our&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.fiberplane.com/why-we-use-rust/" rel="noopener">Rust-centered
                workflow</a></p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Offers good performance</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why we built our own bindings generator</h2>
<p>fp-bindgen&nbsp;is not the only tool to offer WebAssembly bindings.
    However, we do believe it is more flexible and production-ready than any of the alternatives, thanks to the
    following advantages:</p>
<ul
    style="--framer-font-size: 18px; --framer-text-alignment: left; --framer-text-color: rgb(0, 0, 0); --framer-text-decoration: none; --framer-text-transform: none;">
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Support for multiple host environments (Rust/Wasmer and
            TypeScript)</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Allows specifying custom protocol definitions</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Protocols can integrate arbitrary Rust types</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Stable&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">ABI</a>&nbsp;thanks to MessagePack encoding</p>
    </li>
</ul>
