<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Previously, I’ve written about
    <a href="https://fiberplane.com/blog/why-we-at-fiberplane-use-operational-transformation-instead-of-crdt"
        rel="noopener">why we use Operational Transformation at Fiberplane</a>. It’s a complex technology that allows
    multiple people to edit the same content simultaneously. If you’re not familiar with it yet, I would suggest reading
    that post first, so you have a bit of an understanding of what it can do.
</p>
<p>Today, I will explore our implementation a bit more in-depth, so that you get an understanding of not only how things
    work, but why things work the way they do.</p>
<p>If you’re not a programmer, but are simply interested in Operational Transformation and some of the lingo surrounding
    it, the next section is also for you. After that I’ll switch gears and really dig into our implementation, and I’ll
    assume familiarity with
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface" rel="noopener">notebook interfaces</a> and
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model" rel="noopener">client-server architectures</a>.
</p>
<h1>A Primer on Terminology</h1>
<p>Operational Transformation (OT) is a complex technology, and I will be using quite a bit of specific terminology in
    this post. Some of those you may have an intuitive understanding of, while others may sound foreign to you. To make
    sure we’re on the same page, I’ll quickly run through the main terminology with some examples.</p>
<h2>Strings</h2>
<p>For any non-programmers reading this, a
    <em>string</em> is essentially a piece of text, without any formatting or other fancy things.
    <code>"one three five"</code> is a string, and we’ll use it as a starting point for examples going forward. This
    particular string has 14 characters, because we count the spaces as well. We have to be exact in how we count
    things, or subtle bugs (or not so subtle bugs) may occur!
</p>
<p>Note the quotes are not part of the string itself, we use those to indicate where the string starts and ends when
    it’s inside other code.</p>
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>If someone takes the string
    <code>"one three five"</code> and wants to turn this into
    <code>"one two three five"</code>, they need to apply an
    <em>operation</em> to do so. An operation may look like this:
</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<div>
<div aria-live="polite"></div>
<div tabindex="-1">
<div spellcheck="false" autocorrect="off" autocapitalize="none" translate="no" contenteditable="false" role="textbox" aria-multiline="true" aria-readonly="true" data-language="javascript" data-gramm="false" data-lt-active="false" aria-label="Code Editor for example.jsx">
<div>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span></div>
<div>    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>4</span>
<span>,</span></div>
<div>    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>
<span>,</span></div>
<div>    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"two "</span></div>
<div>
<span>}</span></div></div></div></div></pre>
</div>
<p>There’s already a few things of note here:</p>
<ul>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>We only wanted to
            <em>insert</em> the text
            <code>"two "</code>, but we also specified an empty string (
            <code>""</code>) with text to
            <em>remove</em>. This allows us to use a single type of operation for insertion, replacement and removal of
            text.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>We specified the offset where we want the operation to be applied. We will see in a bit why these offsets are
            so important.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Application</h2>
<p>The process of
    <em>applying</em> an operation to go from one state to another is called
    <em>application</em>.
</p>
<p>In these examples we’re using a single string as an example of the state, but in reality we use much more complex
    data structures, of course. Whenever we introduce new data structures, discovering the best way to apply operations
    is often a fun challenge 🙂</p>
<h2>Inversion</h2>
<p>For the algorithm to work correctly, we must be able to
    <em>invert</em> every operation. If we invert the above replace text operation, we would get the following inverted
    operation:
</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span>
    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>4</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"two "</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Intuitively, the result of the inversion process is an operation that allows you to undo the original operation.</p>
<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>Now we get to the heart of the algorithm. Let’s assume Bob wants to insert
    <code>"four "</code> into
    <code>"one three five"</code>. He can do so using this operation:
</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span>
    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>10</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"four "</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>But unbeknownst to him, Alice has already turned the string into
    <code>"one two three five"</code>. If Bob were to still apply his operation at offset 10, the end result would be
    far from what he intended! This is a
    <em>conflict</em>.
</p>
<p>To resolve the conflict, Bob needs to transform his operation so it becomes:</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span>
    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>14</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"four "</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>The OT algorithm does exactly this: It takes one operation, called the successor, then looks at another operation
    that precedes it (the predecessor), and transforms the successor in such a way that the end result is still what the
    author of the successor intended.</p>
<h2>Convergence</h2>
<p>When two operations can be applied in either order while keeping the end result the same, we say they
    <em>converge</em>. Operations that don’t conflict always converge, but those that do need transformation to maintain
    convergence.
</p>
<p>Sometimes it is (near) impossible to decide on a consistent end result that would reflect the intent of all parties
    involved. In situations like that, we may opt to drop an operation. Dropping an operation is really a last resort,
    since it may discard a user’s changes. Whenever this happens, it’s called non-convergence, and we try to avoid this
    wherever we can.</p>
<p>There’s one situation where dropping an operation
    <em>is</em> acceptable, and also doesn’t lead to non-convergence: When two parties try to apply the exact same
    operation. After all, when two users perform the same action, unbeknownst of one another, their most likely
    expectation is that the operation is only performed once. So we can safely drop one. And because the operations were
    the same anyway, order is also irrelevant here.
</p>
<h1>Fiberplane OT</h1>
<p>With most of the terminology out of the way, you hopefully have some understanding of the basic building blocks it
    takes to implement Operational Transformation. At Fiberplane, we have built the OT implementation for our
    <a href="https://docs.fiberplane.com/docs/notebooks" rel="noopener">Notebooks</a> from scratch, using Rust. It’s not
    open-source, since it sits at the heart of our notebook engine, but you can freely have a peak at
    <a href="https://github.com/fiberplane/fiberplane/blob/main/fiberplane-models/src/notebooks/operations.rs"
        rel="noopener">the operation types that we use</a>. There, you’ll find a
    <code>ReplaceTextOperation</code> type among many others. It looks quite like the example I’ve been using thus far,
    though it has a bunch of extra fields to indicate where the operation should be applied.
</p>
<h2>Cell IDs</h2>
<p>So far, I had only used an
    <code>offset</code> field within the operation to identify where in a string a replacement should occur. But our
    notebooks consist of many types of cells, many of which can also have text. So replace text operations also carry a
    <code>cell_id</code> that identifies in which cell we’re currently editing the text.
</p>
<p>💡 When two replace text operations use different cell IDs, they always converge. This is because editing the text of
    disjoint cells will never conflict.</p>
<h2>Fields</h2>
<p>Some cell types even have multiple fields of text. For those situations, we use a field called
    <code>field</code>. For instance, table cells even have
    <em>M x N</em> fields, where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns. To identify which table field
    someone is typing in, we use the format
    <code>{row_id};{column_id}</code>.
</p>
<p>💡 Why not use a row_index instead of a row_id, you ask? row_index could have worked as well, since we can transform
    it the same way we can transform offset for text operations. The reason we use row_id over row_index is that an ID
    remains stable when other rows are inserted or removed. So unlike an index, an ID is less likely to need
    transformation. And that’s easier for us.</p>
<h2>Multi-Cell Selections</h2>
<p>Sometimes, users select text that starts in one cell and ends in another. If they hit
    <em>Space</em> when they have a selection like that, all the text from the start of their selection up to the end of
    the cell, any cells between the starting cell and the ending cell, and the text from the start of the ending cell up
    to the end of the selection, all of it will be replaced by a single space.
</p>
<p>For operations like that, we use the
    <code>ReplaceCellsOperations</code>. It can insert cells, remove cells, and replace ranges that span cells.
</p>
<p>The trickiest parts to understand about the replace cells operations are the fields called
    <code>split_offset</code> and
    <code>merge_offset</code>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>The split offset is the offset at which the first cell in the operation gets split: Everything before the
            split offset is retained, while the rest is replaced.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>The merge offset is the offset at which the last cell in the operation gets merged together: Everything
            before the merge offset is replaced, while the rest is retained.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<span>"on three"</span> 
<span>}</span>
<span>,</span>

<span>]</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>The final content of "cell_one" ends up being "on three". The first two characters ("on") were the cell’s original
    content before it got split (the split offset is 2). Then follows the content from the new_cells as specified in the
    operation, which happened to be only a single space. And finally we merge in the remainder of the last cell, which
    was the entire word "three", because the merge offset is 0.</p>
<p>💡Pay special note to how the content fields in the operation’s old_cells appear to be truncated. This is because
    they only include the text after the split offset, and up to the merge offset.</p>
<h2>Rich-Text Transformation</h2>
<p>Two other interesting fields you’ll find on the
    <code>ReplaceTextOperation</code> in our actual data models are the
    <code>old_formatting</code> and the
    <code>new_formatting</code>. I’ve written before about our
    <a href="https://fiberplane.com/blog/creating-a-rich-text-editor-using-rust-and-react" rel="noopener">custom
        rich-text editor</a>, but in short: Many of our notebook cell types have a
    <code>formatting</code> field that apply formatting to their text. Or in other words: they turn plain text into rich
    text.
</p>
<p>Our data type for formatting looks like this:</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>type </span>
<span>Formatting</span> = 
<span>Vec</span>&lt;
<span>AnnotationWithOffset</span>&gt;
<span>;</span>


<span>struct </span>
<span>AnnotationWithOffset </span>
<span>{</span>
    annotation
<span>:</span> 
<span>Annotation</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>offset</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>u32</span>
<span>,</span>

<span>}</span>


<span>enum </span>
<span>Annotation </span>
<span>{</span>
    
<span>StartBold</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>EndBold</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>StartItalics</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>EndItalics</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>StartLink</span> 
<span>{</span> url
<span>:</span> 
<span>String</span> 
<span>}</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>EndLink</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>/* more like these... */</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>Whenever formatting is included in operations, it is important to keep in mind that the offsets we include in the
    operation are relative to the offset specified there, rather than the start of the cell.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Cell before:</strong>
</p>

<span>:</span> 
<span>7</span> 
<span>}</span>
    
<span>]</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the offsets in the resulting cell aren’t the same offsets as were in the operation. They’re
    calculated using the operation’s offset + each annotation’s offset.</p>
<p>💡We currently don’t have any operations that can alter the formatting without including the text. Of course, nothing
    prevents an operation from specifying new_text and old_text that are identical to one another.</p>
<p>💡What happens if the operation hadn’t specified an EndBold annotation, you ask? Well, then all the text that
    followed the operation would’ve become bold as well. To keep the complexity of the OT engine in check, we explicitly
    don’t consider it an OT responsibility to fix the semantics of the annotations. Instead, those concerns are handled
    by our editor.</p>
<h1>Resolving Conflicts At Identical Offsets</h1>
<p>Previously, I mentioned that we try to avoid non-convergence wherever we can. One edge case where this becomes
    particularly interesting is, what if two people try to insert text at exactly the same offset? Consider the
    following two operations from Alice and Bob:</p>
<p>
    <strong>Alice:</strong>
</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span>
    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>0</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"two "</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>
    <strong>Bob:</strong>
</p>
<div>
    <pre translate="no">
<code>
<span>ReplaceTextOperation </span>
<span>{</span>
    offset
<span>:</span> 
<span>0</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>old_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>""</span>
<span>,</span>
    
<span>new_text</span>
<span>:</span> 
<span>"three "</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>If we want these operations to converge, we have to pick one that will go first, and transform the other. What will
    the end result be? Should it be
    <code>"two three "</code>, or
    <code>"three two "</code>?
</p>
<p>Whenever we are faced with a decision like this, we simply sort the operations by their content using lexicographical
    order. One is always bigger than the other, because identical operations get dropped. So in this case
    <code>"three two "</code> is the winner, because
    <code>"three"</code> comes lexicographically before
    <code>"two"</code>.
</p>
<h1>Rebasing</h1>
<p>At this point, you’ve seen the building blocks of the OT algorithm, as well as some of the capabilities of things we
    can do with our OT engine. Now I have one final topic that should hopefully help to connect some of the dots of how
    all of this comes together in our implementation.</p>
<p>Whenever someone is typing in a Fiberplane Notebook, the client continuously generates operations that reflect the
    user’s intention. Those operations are immediately applied to their local client, so they can see their changes
    instantly. With a slight delay, and some batching under the hood (as well as operation
    <em>merging</em> — because we really don’t need every individual character typed to be an independent operation),
    the client sends those operations to our servers.
</p>
<p>Whenever one or more operations are sent, the client also tells the server which
    <em>revision</em> it assigned to those operations. Revisions are simple integers, so whenever a client is on
    revision
    <em>X</em>, the next operation it applies gets revision
    <em>X + 1</em>. If the server was still on revision
    <em>X</em>, it will accept the operation (after
    <em>validation</em> — I really could’ve made this post quite a bit longer still 😛) and send an
    <code>Ack</code> message back to the client. All is good.
</p>
<p>But if the server had already accepted a revision
    <em>X + 1</em> from another client, the server will send a
    <code>Reject</code> message to the later client, and it becomes the client’s responsibility to
    <em>rebase</em>.
</p>
<p>💡Rebasing could also be done on the server, and it would solve a potential issue with starvation of clients.
    Starvation can happen when a client gets continuously rejected because other clients are always faster than it. In
    practice, this hasn’t been an issue for us yet, which is why we opted for the simpler solution for now.</p>
<p>The term rebasing is directly influenced by
    <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing" rel="noopener">Git</a>, because it follows the same
    basic idea. For a Fiberplane client, rebasing involves the following steps:
</p>
<ul>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>It first reverts all its locally-applied operations, so it gets back into a state that is consistent with the
            server. Reverting is done by
            <em>inverting</em> its local operations, then
            <em>applying</em> those inverted operations. This is why in our implementation every operation must be
            invertible.
        </p>

        <p>Then it applies the latest operations from the server. This “pulls” its state from an older point in time to
            the latest revision.</p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Then it
            <em>transforms</em> its local operations with the newly received operations.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li data-preset-tag="p">
        <p>Finally, it reapplies its now-transformed local operations.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>After the rebase process, the client can attempt to resubmit its transformed operations. Hopefully, if no other
    clients were ahead of it again, the server would now acknowledge them, and all is good again.</p>
<h1>Wrapping up</h1>
<p>That concludes todays’s deep dive into Fiberplane’s OT implementation. There’s certainly some more topics that could
    be covered on this subject as well, but hopefully I’ve given you both an understanding of the major parts, as well
    as some of the challenges you might encounter if you were to implement OT yourself.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
