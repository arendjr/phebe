<p>
    Today I'm proud to announce the release of
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity">Selectivity.js</a> v1.1.0.
    Selectivity.js is a library for displaying rich select boxes. It is intended
    to be lightweight and flexible and has a modular design, a build system for
    creating custom builds and a proper test suite.
</p>
<p>The new version comes with a few notable changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Shortly after version v1.0.0 was release the project has been officially
        renamed from Select3 to Selectivity. If you are still using the project
        under the Select3 name, this will be a breaking change as all symbols
        have been renamed accordingly. Anyone who jumped in after the name
        change should not have to deal with any API changes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Keyboard support has been vastly improved. All Selectivity inputs can
        now be navigated to using the Tab key. Submenus can now be navigated
        with the keyboard, and submenus can be closed using Backspace. Backspace
        can also be used to clear a selected input if the allowClear option is
        enabled. And finally, some annoying page scrolling issues have been
        fixed when using keyboard navigation to scroll through a longer list of
        results.
    </li>
    <li>
        Compatibility with web forms has been improved so values selected in a
        Selectivity.js instance can be submitted back to a server using regular
        HTML form submission.
    </li>
    <li>
        A Ruby on Rails Gem has been created to facilitate users wanting to use
        Selectivity.js in their Ruby application.
    </li>
    <li>Many bugs have been fixed.</li>
</ul>

    Special thanks go to
    <a href="http://konradjurkowski.pl/">Konrad Jurkowski</a> without whom this
    release would've been significantly less impressive. Specifically, he's
    developed the web forms compatibility and the Ruby on Rails gem for which
    there is a separate project page:
    <a href="https://github.com/msx2/selectivity-rails"
        >https://github.com/msx2/selectivity-rails</a
    >. As part of this work he has also set up our Sass support that we now use
    to generate our stylesheets. And last but not least, he's contributed
    several bugfixes as well.
</p>
<p>
    Additional thanks go to everyone who has submitted Pull Requests or reported
    issues on GitHub!
