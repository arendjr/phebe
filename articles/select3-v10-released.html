    <b>Update:</b> This post mentioned the release of Select3 v1.0. The project
    has since been renamed to Selectivity.js and all references in this post
    have been updated.
</p>
<p>
    After a little over two months of development, I'm proud to announce the
    first stable release of
    <a href="https://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/">Selectivity.js</a>. This
    release follows shortly after we have started using Selectivity in
    production at <a href="https://www.speakap.com/">Speakap</a>, meaning we
    believe it is stable enough to expose our users to it :)
</p>
<p>
    Selectivity.js is a library for displaying rich select boxes. It is intended
    to be lightweight and flexible and has a modular design, a build system for
    creating custom builds and a proper test suite.
</p>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>
    Some noteworthy features have been added to the library over the past month:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Support for submenus, as described in
        <a href="/2015/02/creating-submenus-with-select3.html"
            >a previous blog post</a
        >.
    </li>
    <li>
        An AJAX module, for conveniently performing AJAX requests to fetch
        remote data.
    </li>
    <li>
        An async module, which detects out-of-order responses to requests and
        discards those that are no longer relevant. This is especially useful in
        combination with the AJAX module, but can also be used independently.
    </li>
    <li>
        Selectivity.js now automatically fetches more results when the user
        scrolls to the "Load more" link a dropdown.
    </li>
    <li>
        Dropdowns now detect whether there is enough room to be displayed at the
        bottom of the screen and expand upwards if necessary.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>
    Now that Selectivity has been released with its first stable release, it is
    expected the development of additional features will settle down.
    Maintenance will continue in the form of bug fixes. Some minor features and
    accessibility enhancements are to be expected, but nothing that will break
    the API short-term.
</p>
<p>
    Instead, I intend to shift focus to extending the ecosystem around
    Selectivity.js. For example, I expect to shortly start working on a React.js
    Component for working with Selectivity. Also some specific customizations
    will be released in the form of plugins or add-on modules. Such work will be
    performed in separate repositories and not in the Selectivity.js repository
    however.
</p>
