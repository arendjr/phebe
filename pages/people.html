<h1>People</h1>
<p>My two passions are technology and writing, but neither would exist
    without the people that create them. A good story without a convincing
    protagonist inevitably falls flat. And good technology that doesn't
    cater to the people will never be more than a curio. These are some of
    the people that inspire my life...</p>
