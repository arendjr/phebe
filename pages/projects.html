<h1>Projects</h1>
<p>Ever since my dad taught me my first few lines of BASIC, programming has
    been my passion. I'll present the highlights from recent to old, to
    spare you the history if you're not interested:</p>

    <a href="https://fiberplane.dev/"><b>Fiberplane</b></a><br>
    I am currently working at Fiberplane, where we are building exciting DevOps tooling.
    As part of their efforts, I'm involved with
    <a href="https://github.com/fiberplane/fp-bindgen">fp-bindgen</a>,
    a bindings generator for full-stack WASM plugins.

    <b>This website</b><br>
    This website was custom-built in Rust as an exercise to get familiar
    with the language. Don't expect any marvels, but feel free to look at
    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/phebe">the source</a>.

    <a href="https://www.speakap.com/"><b>Speakap</b></a><br>
    I was a Principal Software Engineer at Speakap, where I worked for over
    7 years. Some open-source projects that I created for them are
    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/text-clipper">text-clipper</a> and
    <a href="http://arendjr.github.io/selectivity/">Selectivity.js</a>.

    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiao_games.SudokuPi"><b>Sudoku Pi</b></a><br>
    Sudoku Pi is a finger-friendly Sudoku game for Android. Kudos to
    <a href="https://www.ciyuxu.nl">my wife</a> for the design.
</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/PlainText"><b>PlainText</b></a><br>
    PlainText is a MUD engine I originally built in C++ and JavaScript as
    a hobby. A port to Rust (again as an exercise to gain experience) is
    WIP.

    <b>Hyves</b><br>
    Hyves used to be the largest social network of the Netherlands. I worked
    there for five-and-a-half years, leading the team that created the Hyves
    Desktop suite using C++/Qt and web technologies. I also developed
    several server-side features in PHP and worked on their chat server
    created using Stackless Python. Finally, I also worked on their mobile
    stack creating hybrid PhoneGap applications for Symbian, Android, iOS
    and BlackBerry. Symbian in particular was a fun one, as I first had to
    built the PhoneGap container itself in C++ :)<br>
    An open-source project (now hopelessly outdated) I developed as part of
    my employment there was
    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/woodpecker">Woodpecker</a>, an
    SCSS compiler written in Python.
</p>
<p class="alternate">
    <b>Distributed friend graph database</b><br>
    For my university's master's project, which I did at Hyves, I created a
    PoC for a distributed friend graph database in C++. It was able to
    efficiently retrieve things like friend recommendations as well as
    determine whether any two people shared a connection in the third
    degree.

    <a href="https://kde.org/"><b>KDE project</b></a><br>
    During my time at university I made several contributions to the KDE
    project on the side. From the search bar for the Konqueror web browser
    and the type-ahead-find feature in its KHTML rendering engine to
    support for the Windows RDP protcol in the KDE Remote Desktop Client
    application. For the latter, rather than reimplementing the RDP
    protocol, I created a patch for the
    <a href="https://www.rdesktop.org/">rdesktop application</a> so that
    its X11 window could be embedded into other windows, which was then
    used by KRDC.
</p>
<p class="alternate">
    <b>Real-time raytracing engine</b><br>
    For my university's bachelor's project me and three fellow students
    developed a PoC real-time raytracing engine in C++ with CUDA support. Of
    course, given the hardware at the time, this was only feasible on low
    resolutions using various shortcuts, but it was an interesting project
    nonetheless.
</p>
<p class="alternate">
    <b>Aukyla</b><br>
    During my first part-time job, I worked as a solo developer in a
    <a href="https://www.auton.nl/">small automation firm</a> that lead to
    the formation of Aukyla Software, where I did what every programmer did
    at the time: Create their own PHP CMS. I created the
    <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/aukyla/">Aukyla PHP Framework</a>,
    upon which I built <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/adms/">ADMS</a>,
    an intranet-focused Document Management System, and Aukyla Site Manager,
    which powered several public websites at the time.

    <a href="https://github.com/arendjr/Qivrit"><b>Qivrit</b></a><br>
    In order to help myself and fellow classmates in high-school improve our
    natural language skills, I developed a little Windows application using
    Borland C++ Builder. The concept was simple: You enter the lists of all
    the words with their translations, and the program will question you on
    your knowledge of them afterwards. I don't think I have the source to
    this application anymore, but years later, as I made an attempt to learn
    Hebrew, I wrote a similar program called Qivrit. This one was also
    written in C++, but using Qt and tests both knowledge of the Hebrew
    alphabet as well as basic vocabulary.

    <b>Adventure</b><br>
    One of my oldest hobby projects is a game: Adventure. If my memory
    serves me right, the first version was created in QBASIC. When I started
    using KDE, I made a port called
    <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1109408/">KAdventure</a>.
